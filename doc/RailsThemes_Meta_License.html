If your payment is rejected, refunded, or otherwise not successfully transferred to the Company, your purchase shall be cancelled and no license shall be granted hereunder. We are required to collect the full cost of your purchase, including all taxes (as applicable) at the time you purchase your Product(s) and/or Update(s). Within a reasonable time after your purchase is confirmed, an e-mail containing your download key and detailed download and installation instructions shall be sent to the e-mail address you have provided to the Company (your &quot;E-mail&quot;).
